# Mastercard Forage — Phishing Awareness Project

This repo contains my deliverables for the **Mastercard Virtual Experience Program on Forage**:  
- **Task 1:** Craft a realistic phishing email simulation to raise employee awareness.  
- **Task 2:** Create a short training presentation (3–5 slides) to educate employees on phishing and how to avoid it.

- Urgency to encourage action  
- Safe placeholder link (`https://training.example.com/mc/sso/verify`)
