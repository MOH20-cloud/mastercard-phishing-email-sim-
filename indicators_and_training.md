# Indicators, Guidance & Micro‑Training Script

## Indicators employees should check
- Sender domain and display name consistency
- Link hover preview vs visible text
- Generic vs specific greeting
- Unusual urgency or threats
- Requests for credentials or MFA re‑enrollment

## Recommended micro‑training (60–90 seconds)
1. Hover over the link. Does it match an internal domain you recognize?
2. Check the sender’s domain (and Reply‑To) carefully.
3. If the email mentions a ticket, search the ticket number in the official helpdesk portal.
4. When in doubt, contact the Service Desk via your usual channel—don’t reply to the email.

## Metrics to track (for a simulation run)
- Delivery rate, Open rate, Click‑through rate (CTR), Report rate
- Time‑to‑report (median)
- False positive rate on reports
